   <li>You are going to stir all of these ingredients in together until you get a nice bubbly batter like texture. Make sure it's not too thin or thick. </li>
   <li>Then, you will add in your butter to coat the pan, this way the pancake won't burn too easily. You will then pour about a 1/4 cup of your batter into your warmed up skillet pan</li>
   <li>Next, you will let your pancake rest in the pan, until the underside is lightly golden brown. At this point you are going to want to flip over your pancake.</li>
   <li>Make sure to only cook your pancakes for 1-4 minutes, to make sure they aren't browning too quickly.</li>
